# Web Scrap Agent (n8n Workflow)

## üìå Overview
The **Web Scrap Agent** is an automated workflow built with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) that scrapes job listings from multiple websites, rewrites the content using AI, and publishes the results directly to a WordPress site. It also integrates with Airtable for job post tracking and deduplication.

- Rewrites the job announcement in **Arabic** with **100% original wording**.
- Uploads job images and creates a WordPress post (with featured image).
